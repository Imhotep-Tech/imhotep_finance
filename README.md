## 📖 About

**Imhotep Finance** is an open-source personal finance management platform built with Django, React, and React Native. It provides both a powerful web application and a native mobile app to help you track transactions, manage budgets, set savings goals, and automate recurring expenses. Perfect for individuals seeking a secure, user-friendly way to monitor spending, analyze patterns, and achieve financial freedom—anytime, anywhere.

> *"Your finances, simplified. Your goals, achieved."*

### 🏠 Self-Hostable - Deploy Anywhere

Imhotep Finance is designed to be **completely self-hostable** with no external dependencies or vendor lock-in. You have full control:

- **Deploy anywhere**: Your own server, cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP), or your infrastructure
- **Complete data ownership**: All data stays on your servers - no third-party services required
- **Privacy first**: No tracking, no analytics sent to external services
- **Free to use**: Use it for free for any purpose (personal or commercial within your organization)
- **Easy setup**: One-command Docker deployment or manual installation

See [Self-Hosting Guide](.docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) and [Development Workflow](.docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md) for the two recommended onboarding paths.
